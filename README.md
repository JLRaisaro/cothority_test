# Template for the SDA-framework

For those who are using the SDA-framework available at https://github.com/dedis/onet, this
repo holds templates for using the framework at different levels:

* protocol - define an ephemeral, distributed, decetralized protocol
* service - create a long-term service that can spawn any number of protocols
* app - write an app that will interact with, or spawn, a cothority

This repo is geared towards PhD-students who want to use the ONet-library
for creating their own protocols, services and apps. The wiki has a lot of
information at https://github.com/dedis/cothority_template/wiki.
